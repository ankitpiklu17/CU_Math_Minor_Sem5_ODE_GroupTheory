##📘 Lecture Notes Repository

This repository contains my lecture notes on Group Theory and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) for the course taught to Semester V students of the Mathematics Minor program, University of Calcutta.

🔹 Group Theory

The Group Theory section covers the topics discussed in class and is intended to help students understand core algebraic structures through definitions, theorems, and examples.

🔹 Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)

This section contains selected lecture notes on ODE.

⚠️ Disclaimer (ODE only):
The basic introductory part of ODE is not covered completely in these notes. The material mainly focuses on topics discussed after the introductory portion during lectures.
